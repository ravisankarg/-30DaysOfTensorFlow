### key concepts 
* Optimized for on-device machine learning, by addressing key constraints: 
  * latency (there's no round-trip to a server),
  * privacy (no personal data leaves the device), 
  * size (reduced model and binary size)
  * power consumption (efficient inference and a lack of network connections).
* Multiple platform support, covering Android and iOS devices, embedded Linux, and microcontrollers.

Key Point: The TensorFlow Lite binary is ~1MB when all 125+ supported operators are linked (for 32-bit ARM builds), and less than 300KB when using only the operators needed for supporting the common image classification models InceptionV3 and MobileNet.

* Diverse language support, which includes Java, Swift, Objective-C, C++, and Python.
