### key concepts 
Optimized for on-device machine learning, by addressing 5 key constraints: latency (there's no round-trip to a server), privacy (no personal data leaves the device), connectivity (internet connectivity is not required), size (reduced model and binary size) and power consumption (efficient inference and a lack of network connections).
Multiple platform support, covering Android and iOS devices, embedded Linux, and microcontrollers.

Key Point: The TensorFlow Lite binary is ~1MB when all 125+ supported operators are linked (for 32-bit ARM builds), and less than 300KB when using only the operators needed for supporting the common image classification models InceptionV3 and MobileNet.

Diverse language support, which includes Java, Swift, Objective-C, C++, and Python.
High performance, with hardware acceleration and model optimization.
